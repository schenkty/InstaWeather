# SimpliWeather
Simple Weather App based on Treehouse's Weather App Course

If being used or built upon, Update API Key in DarkSkyAPIClient.swift file. Failure to update key will make app not work properly

Treehouse Project Description:
In this project, we're going to build a weather app together and broaden our understanding of Swift and iOS frameworks. We will start by learning foundational concepts like networking and concurrency while building on our existing knowledge of data modeling, view models and more. Weâ€™ll even take a look at how we can structure our code better and construct decoupled classes and structs that lead to greater code reuse. Let's get started!

What you'll learn

- Networking
- Concurrency
- JSON
- URLSession
